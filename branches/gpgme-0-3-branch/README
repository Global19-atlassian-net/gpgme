                  GPGME - GnuPG Made Easy
                ---------------------------
                       Version 0.3

This is the stable branch of GPGME.  We don't intend to make any
changes to the API anymore but OTOH we won't add any new features.
The development version is available in the CVS; after we have
released that onem we will slowly fade out support for this 0.3 branch.

If you want to hack on it, start with one of the `tests/gpg/t-foo'
programs.

For support of the OpenPGP protocol (default), you need at least GnuPG
1.2.0.

If configure can't find the `gpg' binary in your path, you can specify
the location with the --with-gpg=/path/to/gpg argument to configure.

For support of the CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) protocol, you
need at least newpg 0.9.2 or GnuPG > 1.9.2.

If configure can't find the `gpgsm' binary in your path, you can
specify the location with the --with-gpgsm=/path/to/gpgsm argument to
configure.

Before building the CVS version following the generic install
instructions in `INSTALL', you need to set up the build scripts with
`./autogen.sh'.  To build the W32 version, use `./autogen.sh
--build-w32'.  You also need to enable maintainer mode at configure
time with `--enable-maintainer-mode', or the documentation will not
built (because the version.texi won't be generated unless maintainer
mode is enabled).

Please subscribe to the gnupg-devel@gnupg.org mailing list if you want
to do serious work.
