XML Schemas
===========

The XML schemas in this directory are available under the same terms
as GPGME (i.e. the GPL 2 or later or the LGPL 2.1 or later), or
alternatively the Apache 2.0 license.

The schemas were generated with oXygenXML Editor 17.1 (mentioning that
isn't necessary, but might be helpful).
