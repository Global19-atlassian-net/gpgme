Working examples

The examples from the Python 2 code base do not work and it appears
that they don't under Python 2 either.  These ought to be replaced or
updated with examples from the GPGME documentation.

Documentation

Currently this appears to be buried in the debian/ directory for some
unknown reason, probably pertaining to one of the other developers.
Documentation is to be moved to a more appropriate docs/ directory and
produced using reST in preparation for inevitable publication by way
of Sphinx and the existing infrastructure at readthedocs.org or the
projects new home at gnupg.org.

Alternatively Org-Mode might be used, as with the rest of the GNU
Privacy Guard projects.

The third option is to use an XML based build process with greater
support for multilingual publications such as those provided by ruby
domains (that's the XML ruby, not the programming language ruby;
they're totally different things).
