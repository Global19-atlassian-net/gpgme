Test extension:

The test extension contains tests with mocha and chai. It will be packed as an
extra extension (see build_extension.sh).

Tests from BrowserTestExtension/tests will be run against the gpgmejs.bundle.js
itself. They aim to test the outward facing functionality and API.

Unittests as defined in ./unittests.js will be bundled in
gpgmejs_unittests.bundle.js, and test the separate components of gpgmejs,
which mostly are not exported.

The BrowserExtension can be installed the same way as the DemoExtension
(see README).
