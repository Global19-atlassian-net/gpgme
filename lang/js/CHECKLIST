NativeConnection:

    [X] nativeConnection: successfully sending an encrypt request,
receiving an answer
    [X] nativeConnection successfull on Chromium, chrome and firefox
    [ ] nativeConnection successfull on Windows, macOS, Linux
    [ ] nativeConnection with delayed, multipart (> 1MB) answer

replicating Openpgpjs API:

    [*] Message handling (encrypt, verify, sign)
    [ ] Key handling (import/export, modifying, status queries)
    [ ] Configuration handling
    [ ] check for completeness
    [ ] handling of differences to openpgpjs

Communication with other implementations

    [ ] option to export SECRET Key into localstore used by e.g. mailvelope

Management:
    [*] Define the gpgme interface
    [ ] check Permissions (e.g. csp) for the different envs
    [ ] agree on license
    [ ] tests


Problems:
    [X] gpgme-json: interactive mode vs. bytelength; filename
    [X] nativeApp chokes on arrays. We will get rid of that bnativeapp anyhow
