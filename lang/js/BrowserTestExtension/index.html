    <h3>gpgmejs - Tests</h3>
    <p>
        The unittests rely on a separately packaged version of gpgmejs,
        with the different classes and functions exposed. These tests and their
        input values can be found in gpgme/lang/js/test. They do not test the
        overall functionality, but the individual behaviour of the components.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="unittests.html">
                    Unittests of the individual functions and classes.
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The functionality tests, to be found in
        gpgme/lang/js/BrowserTestExtension, check the overall functionality of
        the standard  packaged version of gpgmejs.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="browsertest.html">
                    Functionality tests using the bundled library.
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="longTests.html">
                    Functionality tests with larger/longer running data sets.
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="openpgpModeTest.html">
                    Testing openPGP mode.
                </a> - Please notice that, due to comparing
                    the inputs and outputs with openpgpjs objects, this test
                    requires a copy of openpgpjs in libs.
